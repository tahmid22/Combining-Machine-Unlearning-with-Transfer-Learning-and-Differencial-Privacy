# Machine Unlearning with SISA
### Lucas Bourtoule, Varun Chandrasekaran, Christopher Choquette-Choo, Hengrui Jia, Adelin Travers, Baiwu Zhang, David Lie, Nicolas Papernot
This repository contains the core code used in the SISA experiments of our [Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03817) paper along with some example scripts.

You can start runing experiments by having a look at the readme in the purchase example folder at ``example-scripts/purchase-sharding``.

``sisa.py`` is the script that trains a given shard. It should be run as many times as the number of shards.
